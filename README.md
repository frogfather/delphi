# delphi
This is not strictly a Delphi file as it was created in Borland Kylix 3 (Delphi 5 ported to Linux) 
This represents the very small portion of my Hotel management software which was used live between 2004 and 2012 when we ran
a small hotel. The majority of it will not be seeing the light of day... ever!
