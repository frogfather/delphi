# delphi
These are not strictly Delphi files as they were created in Borland Kylix 3 (Delphi 5 ported to Linux) 
They can probably be complied in a Delphi complier if the unit names are changed - usually by knocking 
the Q off the front of them. So QDateutils changes to DateUtils etc. 

This is old code used in hospitality software at a hotel I owned between 2004 and 2012. The point of sale (accsales) and bookings are very old - I apologise unreservedly for the huge number of global variables. The reconcile module is newer and rather better written.
